## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Unified AI Testing Dashboard (`/test-ai`)

### **Location:** `src/app/test-ai/page.tsx`

### **Purpose:**

- Centralizes all AI and API testing in a single, user-friendly interface
- Allows rapid, interactive testing of all major AI endpoints
- Provides real-time feedback, error handling, and beautiful result visualization

### **Features:**

- **Dropdown menu** to select which API to test (OpenAI, Deep Research, Pre-Demo Checklist, Chat)
- **Dynamic input forms**: Input fields change based on the selected API
- **Run Test** button triggers the API call
- **Real-time progress**: Streaming updates for long-running tasks (e.g., Deep Research)
- **Results display**: Gradient cards, icons, and structured sections for each API's output
- **Error handling**: Clear, color-coded error messages with icons
- **Reset**: Quickly clear results and start a new test
- **Type safety**: All forms and results are fully typed with TypeScript

### **User Experience:**

- **Select API** ‚Üí **Fill in form** ‚Üí **Run Test** ‚Üí **See live progress/results**
- **Errors** are shown in red with details and troubleshooting hints
- **Success** is shown with green/blue/purple cards and structured data
- **Debug info** (in development) is available for advanced users

### **Tested APIs:**

- **OpenAI Connection**: Verifies API key and model access
- **Deep Research**: Tests real-time company research with web search
- **Pre-Demo Checklist**: Generates a comprehensive checklist for demo prep
- **Chat**: Tests the AI chat assistant with context

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Command-Line & Scripted Testing

### **Shell Script:** `test-apis.sh`

- **Purpose**: Allows developers to test all API endpoints from the command line
- **Features**:
  - Runs `curl` requests against each API endpoint
  - Prints results and errors to the terminal
  - Can be used in CI/CD or for quick regression testing
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  bash test-apis.sh
  ```

### **Node.js Environment Check:** `check-env.js`

- **Purpose**: Ensures all required environment variables and API keys are set
- **Features**:
  - Checks for OpenAI and Supabase keys
  - Prints warnings/errors for missing configuration

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ API Endpoint Testing

### **API Test Endpoints:**

- `/api/test/openai`: Tests OpenAI API connection and model access
- `/api/test/pre-demo-checklist`: Tests checklist generation
- `/api/deep-research`: Tests Deep Research API (with streaming)
- `/api/chat`: Tests chat API with sample messages

### **Testing Flow:**

- **POST** requests are sent with sample payloads
- **Responses** are checked for success, error, and expected data structure
- **Streaming** (SSE) is tested for Deep Research, with progress and completion events

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Error Handling & Result Display

### **Error Handling:**

- **Frontend**: All errors are caught and displayed with clear messages and icons
- **Backend**: API routes return structured error objects with status codes
- **Streaming**: Errors during streaming are sent as SSE events and displayed live
- **TypeScript**: Type safety ensures only valid data is processed

### **Result Display:**

- **Success**: Results are shown in color-coded, structured cards (green, blue, purple)
- **Progress**: Live updates for long-running tasks (e.g., Deep Research)
- **Citations**: Sources and metadata are shown for research APIs
- **Debug Info**: Raw JSON and metadata available in development mode

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Best Practices & Advanced Strategies

- **Unified dashboard**: Reduces context switching and makes QA easier
- **Streaming support**: Real-time feedback for long-running AI tasks
- **Type safety**: Prevents runtime errors and ensures reliable test results
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Both backend and frontend
- **Beautiful, professional UI**: Encourages thorough testing by all stakeholders
- **Scripted CLI testing**: Enables automation and CI/CD integration
- **Environment validation**: Prevents misconfiguration before tests run

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Example Test Flows

### **A. Deep Research API (Streaming)**

1. User selects "Deep Research" in the dashboard
2. Enters company name and requirements
3. Clicks "Run Test"
4. Sees live progress (searching, analyzing)
5. Final structured report is displayed with sources and metadata
6. Errors (e.g., model not available) are shown with fallback info

### **B. Chat API**

1. User selects "Chat" in the dashboard
2. Enters a message
3. Clicks "Run Test"
4. AI response is shown with model and token usage
5. Errors (e.g., API key issues) are shown clearly

### **C. Command-Line**

1. Developer runs `bash test-apis.sh`
2. All endpoints are tested in sequence
3. Results and errors are printed to the terminal
